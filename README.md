A gtk4-based rust application to customize the xfce desktop environment. 

installation:
download the latest version, then open a terminal and type `sudo /path/to/file/xf-tewaks`. be sure to replace the path in the command with the actual path.

If you get an error, type `sudo chmo +x /path/to/file/xf-tweaks && sudo /path/to/file/xf-tewaks`. this will make the file executable and then run it.
